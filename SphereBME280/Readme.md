## Lab #7: Connecting an I2C sensor (Bosch BME280) and send telemetry to Azure IoT Central

The libBME280 project contains a wrapper library based on the original [Bosch driver](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BME280_driver) for the 
Bosch BME280 temperature-, humidity- and pressure-sensor.

This sensor is e.g. available as [Seeed Groove BME280 sensor board](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BME280/) amongst other suppliers
