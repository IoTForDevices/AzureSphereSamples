# Connecting an OLED display
This lab requires e.g. the [Seeedstudio Grove 0.96" OLED display](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_OLED_Display_0.96/raw/master/resource/SSD1308_1.0.pdf) that is based 
on the [Solomon Systech SSD130x](http://www.solomon-systech.com/en/product/...ic/oled-driver-controller/ssd1308/) OLED driver chip and 
is connected through the I2C interface.
